This analysis is performed to study the relationship among passengers that survived the titanic incident with various factors (like age, gender, passenger class) that affect the survival probability. This is a basic project with visualisation present for better understanding for all users. users can download and use source code from Src. This is a public repository and the primary purpose of this repository is "Academic". Hence, this is maintained by me and is to be analysed and validated by the instructor.
