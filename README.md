## Titanic EDA
### Src - Soure Code
### Data - Dataset used (Titanic.csv)
### Result - Plots and report
This analysis is performed to study the relationship among passengers that survived the titanic incident with various factors (like age, gender, passenger class) that affect the survival probability. This is a basic project with visualisation present for better understanding for all users. Users can download and use source code from src. This is a public repository and the primary purpose of this repository is for "Academic Usage". Hence, this is maintained by me and is to be analysed and validated by the instructor.
